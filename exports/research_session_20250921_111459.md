## Q&A History

### Question 1
**Q:** What are the core transformer architectures mentioned in the Nougat and Attn-Adapter papers?

**A:** The core transformer architectures mentioned in the Nougat paper include an encoder-decoder transformer architecture, characterized as a Visual Transformer model. In the Attn-Adapter paper, the core transformer architectures mentioned are ViT-B/32 and ViT-B/16.

### Question 3
**Q:** What is  Memory Attn-Adapter?

**A:** Memory Attn-Adapter is a component of a dual attention architecture. Its purpose is to capture dataset-specific information by dynamically combining support embeddings, taking into account the relationship between categories and few-shot images. It refines category embeddings using support examples, effectively ignoring outliers and focusing on relevant samples to create robust feature representations. It is also one of two trainable modules in a lightweight online few-shot learning framework.

### Question 5
**Q:** can you provide the formula for it?

**A:** Based on the provided context, the Memory Attn-Adapter takes the category embedding \(w\) and the support feature set \(\mathbf{F}\) as input, and outputs a refined category embedding \(\hat{w}\). The operation is represented as \(\hat{w}=\) Memory Attn-Adapter\((w,\mathbf{F})\). However, the specific internal formula or mathematical details of how the Memory Attn-Adapter processes these inputs to produce \(\hat{w}\) are not provided in the available information.

### Question 6
**Q:** Research Summary: What is  Memory Attn-Adapter?

**A:** The Memory Attn-Adapter is a crucial component within a lightweight online few-shot learning framework, specifically designed to improve the performance of vision-language models.

**Key Methodologies:**
The core methodology of the Memory Attn-Adapter revolves around the application of **cross-attention**. In this mechanism, it refines category embeddings by dynamically combining support embeddings. These support embeddings serve a dual role, acting as both keys and values within the cross-attention process. This dynamic combination is guided by the relationships observed between categories and the few-shot images available, allowing the adapter to focus on relevant samples and effectively disregard outliers. This process helps in creating more robust feature representations for categories.

**Findings and Implications:**
As one of two trainable modules in its framework, the Memory Attn-Adapter plays a significant role in imposing dataset-specific information during the fine-tuning process. This dual attention mechanism, which includes the Memory Attn-Adapter, leads to more effective generalization across a variety of datasets and tasks. The implication of this is a novel strategy for fully leveraging trainable frameworks in few-shot learning, enabling vision-language models to adapt and perform well with minimal training data by dynamically refining their understanding of categories based on limited examples.
